# Data Persistence Unity submit

An unity project challenge which data persistence (both between scenes and between sessions) has to be implemented in a new game project : saving the userâ€™s name between scenes and saving the high score between sessions.

In this submission, those tasks have been realized :
* Create a new repo
* Do an initial commit
* Import a project to version control and commit it
* Implement data persistence between scenes and sessions
